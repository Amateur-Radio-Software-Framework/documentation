File Headers
------------

When writing a Node.js application, it is recommended to add a header section to your application. This will include some basic information. As a general starting point the following code is an example of a Node.js header section

.. code-block:: javaapplication

    /*
    Description: A short description of what this node.js application does

    This code was written in compliance with the Amateur Radio Software Framework (ARSFW)
    https://amateur-radio-software-framework.github.io/documentation/

    __author__ = 'Your Name'
    __copyright__ = 'Copyright 2024, project_name'
    __credits__ = ['Names of Anyone who contributed to this code']
    __license__ = 'GPLv3'
    __version__ = '1.0.0'
    __maintainer__ = 'Your Name and anyone else who maintains this code'
    __email__ = 'you@example.com'
    __status__ = 'development or production'
    */

With the above header listed in your file, everyone who views the file will get all the information they need about the application, and know it was developed following the standards of the Amateur Radio Software FrameWork.
