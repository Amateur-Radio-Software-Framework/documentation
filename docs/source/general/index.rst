There are some generic general truths regardless of what language chosen for development. This is where those things shall be discussed in depth. 

Before you begin development
############################

Here are some things you should ask yourself and consider before you begin writing any code for any new project. And be completely honest with yourself. Don't just convince yourself this is needed just because you thought of it. 

1. Is there already a tool out there that does what I am trying to do?

    If the answer is Yes

      1. Am I wanting to reinvent the wheel and build the exact same thing?
      2. Do I want to build something slightly different than what already exist?
      3. Do I want to fork the existing tool and add to it?
   
    If the answer is No

      1. Is there a userbase for such a tool? 
      2. Is the return really worth the investment to develop this tool?
      3. Does this tool provide value to the community? If so, what is that value?
2. Have I developed a roadmap of the code I want to write?
3. Have I developed a detailed list of functionality/features I want to provide in my tool?
