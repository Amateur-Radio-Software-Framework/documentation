# Contributing

First of all, thanks for the taking time to contribute and help people!

This document contains a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. These guidelines are intended to provide a clear and concise way to help you to know where help is needed and how you can contribute to improve the guide.

## Where can I help?

There are several ways to contribute. A contribution can only happen in the form of a pull request. Any kind of help would be appreciated.

In special, I'd like to highlight and bring attention to help in the form of:

- Development of best practices and standards
- Fix of inconsistencies across documentation
- Grammar and spelling corrections
- Improvement of source referencing (images, references, etc.)
- Incorrect, inconsistent or incomplete information fixes
- Pull request reviews
- Reporting of issues
- Additions to the documentation

## Principles

- **Consistency across languages over 100% correct grammar/spelling**: It's better to have some grammar and spelling errors than having outdated or specialized content for a single language. Use Google Translate or similar tools when needed.
- **Best practices in this guide should aim to help, not to set rule-following blindly standards**: It's intended to provide resourceful guidelines to help others develop code in a better, concise and clear way. It's a mean to an end, not the end itself.
- **One size does not fit all**: A project,  or team standards and agreements may override common practices. People may not agree 100% with all practices and it's ok. 


### How to Contribute

- Fork the project to make changes to the repository. See [this Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) explaining how to do it.
- Create a branch with the following naming format, **callisgn/branch name**. An example of this may be **KW4JLB/feat-add-python-standards**
- Make your changes and commit them to your branch
- Open a pull request to submit your changes for review. If approved the changes will be merged in. 

### Contributing Guidlines

- Use English for commit messages, issues and pull requests (both description and discussions).
- Add `[PROPOSAL]` prefix to PR title when doing additions other than translations or corrections (e.g., [#31](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/pull/31))
- Github editor usually suggests a commit message like "Update file", add a description of your change in the commit body or change the title.
    - A good example: [7747659](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/commit/7747659824b83f6d07589daa66a67ee29fa60ddb)

It worth noting again that the best practices described in this guide are _guidelines_ and not rules. I won't refuse your contribution nor nitpick your commit messages if you're not following them strictly. It aims to help.

### New translation checklist

- Make sure you're working in the most updated branch. Rebase your code and fix conflicts when needed.
- Make sure you've updated the [Available languages section](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide#available-languages) section in (and only in) README.md.
- Make sure you haven't included `Available languages` section in your translation (See [#31](https://github.com/RomuloOliveira/commit-messages-guide/pull/31)).

### Pull Request review process

There will be at least 1 review from a member of the ARSFW organization. This is required. All pull requests will stay open until they have been reviewed.

All discussions should be resolved before a merge.
